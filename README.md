# Portfolio

My current portfolio page as of July 2021. Built using Sass and JavaScript, my aim was to build a clean and functional site without too many distracting animations while earning a high Lighthouse score.

## Lessons Learned

During the design process, before actually building the portfolio, I contemplated using Gatsby to generate the site, or use Material-UI for my site's styling. I eventually settled on the idea of builing a reactive website from scratch.

It was advised to me to start building the site with the mobile format in mind, then work my way to tablet and desktop displays. I found this to be much more effecient in the end. In one of my previous apps I worked the other way, desktop first then mobile and found it a real struggle.

When the site was finished, I then had to learn how to deploy to Netlify, impliment their submission form into my page and change the DNS records to point to my personal domain. I thoughly enjoyed the feeling of having a fully deployed webpage up and running.

## Potential Future Features

- I'm currenly happy with the majority of the core functionality of the website. At the moment the there's only two things I would change: 
    
    - Add a dark mode/ligh mode toggle using css variables

    - Add a few more low key transitions - ie the mobile menu sliding in from the side

## Deployment

Deployed with [github pages](https://pages.github.com/).
